# Obsidian-theme-Hulk-vs-Dracula
A custom CSS theme for Obsidian inspired by The Incredible Hulk with colours stolen from Dracula.
Dark theme only, because Dracula doesn't come out in the light.



## Instructions

1. In Obsidian, click Settings->Plugins and turn on "Custom CSS".
2. Go to Settings -> Community themes to activate

## Licence
This theme was modified from the work of other Obsidian members' themes, so feel free to modify to your own preferenceâ€”and look out for my Custom CSS Guide to assist with changing colours! Coming Soon...
